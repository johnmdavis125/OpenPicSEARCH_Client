Overview

+ OpenPix is a full-stack MERN application intended to expedite the process of searching for open domain images/assets for creative design projects. This is accomplished by accepting a single search term into the OpenPix UI searchbar, which prompts simultaneous API pulls from multiple popular public domain resource sites such as Pexels, Unsplash, & Pixabay. Search results can be individually selected & saved to a queue, where the user can save them into custom collections they’ve created. 

Project Status: Incomplete, but basic MVP for “Search”, “Queue”, & “Collections” in place and ready for demo. 

Background
